The chi-squared function helps test the independence of the columns in the dataset to determine whether the missingness is completely independent of each other - MAR: Missing at random. If the missingness is not MCAR, it may be MAR; however, further domain knowledge is required to make this determination. - MNAR: Missing not at random. Domain expertise is required to determine whether this type of missingness is present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\ndf\n\nA pandas dataframe to analyze missingness.\nrequired\n\n\nalpha\n\nThe significant level to test the p.value that result from the chi-squared test\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\npandas.DataFrame\nThe table contains two columns: one shows the names of the columns in the dataset, and the other indicates whether each column is MCAR, MAR, or MNAR.

High positive correlations flag variables that tend to be missing at the same time, which can reveal shared data-collection issues or common missingness mechanisms.\nParameters df : pd.DataFrame A pandas DataFrame for which the pairwise correlations of missing values across columns should be computed.\nReturns pd.DataFrame A square DataFrame whose rows and columns correspond to the original variables, and whose entries give the correlation between their missingness indicators."
