# missing_correlation_matrix.missing_correlation_matrix { #missingness_analyzer.missing_correlation_matrix.missing_correlation_matrix }

```python
missing_correlation_matrix.missing_correlation_matrix(df)
```

Calculate correlations between variables' missingness patterns.

For each column in `df`, this function constructs a binary indicator
(1 = value is missing, 0 = value is observed) and computes the
pairwise correlation matrix of these indicators. High positive
correlations flag variables that tend to be missing at the same time,
which can reveal shared data-collection issues or common missingness mechanisms.

Parameters
df : pd.DataFrame
    A pandas DataFrame for which the pairwise correlations of missing
    values across columns should be computed.

Returns
pd.DataFrame
    A square DataFrame whose rows and columns correspond to the original
    variables, and whose entries give the correlation between their
    missingness indicators.
